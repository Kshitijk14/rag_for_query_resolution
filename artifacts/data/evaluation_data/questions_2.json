        "ground_truth": "The miniature tensiometer was used to monitor in situ soil suction at two depths: 25 cm and 45 cm."

        "question": "Why does suction decrease more significantly at 45 cm depth than at 25 cm depth during rainfall periods?",
        "ground_truth": "The more significant suction decrease at 45 cm depth is attributed to the hysteresis phenomenon in the soil’s water retention behavior. The retention curve at 45 cm depth is closer to the bounding drying curve, while at 25 cm it is closer to the wetting curve, leading to a more pronounced decrease in suction during rainfalls at the deeper level."
